            The specialty of a company can be
            judged by the services provided by it.
            For example, some companies focus on
            web and mobile applications while
            others create mostly desktop
            applications. Besides that, some
            software firms provide additional
            services such as software testing. The
            IT Artificer provides both, the web
            development and mobile applications as
            well as desktop applications services.
            Besides this, the trainees are also
            entertained through the service of
            Professional Training.
